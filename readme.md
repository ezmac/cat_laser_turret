# Cat laser toy.

What am I doing with my life?


So, this woman I love has cats.  Those cats hate laser pointers.  And I have a mantra to automate everything.  So, here's an automated solution to annoy her cats while I sit around laughing at them.


## About:
you need 2 servos, a laser, an arduino nano, mechanical skills or a 3d printer.  Also some m3 screws and nuts.  Alternatively, you could order parts from a 3d printing place.


## Modeling was done with OnShape
I'd like to say thanks to OnShape.  For me, it's the best modeling software I have found that runs on Linux.  It's also free if you don't want your work to be private.  I'm a hobbyist, so that's fine with me.

If you want the models, they should be publicly available here: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/e5498a3066a0b71f964ec44d/w/d6f4684e788af28da5df8a50/e/72bd9ef1ca599f107161530c

Otherwise STL is included in v1_model/.

### Important
This model needs a rework.  It was too tippy and I didn't want to waste time on a full redesign and reprint.  Instead, I added a weight tray to the inside and filled it with pennies.  The tolerances are too tight.  It'll work if you work at it, but you should have a file and a lot of patience.  If you flip the weight tray to the outside, it would be much easier to wire.  As it is, I have my pin headers bent about 90 degrees so they're parallel to the board for clearance reasons.  You can also avoid this by direct soldering.



All that said, the project is messy but it does work.  I hope to clean it up later, but I also wanted to get it out there.


Also thanks to the few people on thingiverse who did similar work that wouldn't work for me due to various reasons.
